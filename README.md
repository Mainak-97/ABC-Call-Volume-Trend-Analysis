# Dataset Description

The dataset includes detailed information on customer support calls handled by agents over a specific period. The key attributes of the dataset are:

- **Time Bucket:** Divisions of time intervals (e.g., 9 AM - 10 AM, 10 AM - 11 AM) in which calls are analyzed.

- **Total Calls:** The number of incoming calls received by agents during each time bucket.

- **Average Call Duration:** The average length of calls in seconds for each time bucket.

- **Current Manpower:** The number of agents currently allocated to handle calls during each time bucket.

- **Manpower Needed:** The calculated number of agents required to achieve a specific call abandonment rate.

- **Night Time Calls:** The number of calls received during night hours (9 PM - 9 AM).
# Analysis Methodology

The analysis was conducted in several key steps:

- **Data Cleaning:** Missing values and inconsistencies were addressed to ensure data accuracy.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical analysis was performed to identify patterns and trends in call durations and volumes.

- **Call Volume and Duration Analysis:** Visualizations were created to understand peak hours and time buckets with the longest call durations.

- **Market Segmentation:** Analyzed how different market categories impact car popularity and pricing.

- **Manpower Planning:** Calculations were made to determine the number of agents required during each time bucket to reduce the call abandonment rate from 30% to 10%.

- **Night Shift Planning:** Additional analysis was conducted to determine the manpower required to handle calls during night hours, ensuring a consistent abandonment rate.

# Key Insights

- **Peak Call Times:** The highest volume of calls was received between 11 AM and 12 PM, representing 12.4% of total calls.

- **Average Call Duration:** The longest calls occurred between 10 AM - 11 AM, 6 PM - 7 PM, and 7 PM - 8 PM, averaging 203 seconds.

- **Manpower Optimization:** To achieve a 10% abandonment rate, 79 agents are required during peak hours, compared to the current 66 agents at a 30% abandonment rate.

- **Night Shift Requirements:** An additional 22 agents are needed to handle calls during night hours, maintaining a consistent abandonment rate.
